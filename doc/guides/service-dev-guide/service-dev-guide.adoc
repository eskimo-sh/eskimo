== Introduction

=== Eskimo

A state of the art _Big Data Infrastructure_ and _Management Web Console_ to _build_, _manage_ and _operate_
*Big Data 2.0 Analytics clusters*


image::pngs/eskimo.jpg[50, 50, align="center"]

Eskimo is in a certain way the Operating System of your Big Data Cluster:

* A _plug and play_, working _out of the Box_, *Big Data Analytics platform* fulfilling _enterprise environment
requirements_.
* A *state of the art Big Data 2.0 platform*
** based on _Docker_, _Marathon_, _Mesos_ and _Systemd_
** packaging _Gluster_, _Spark_, _Kafka_, _Flink_, _Nifi_ and _ElasticSearch_
** with all the administration and management consoles such as _Cerebro_, _Kibana_, _Zeppelin_, _Kafka-Manager_,
_Grafana_ and _Prometheus_.
* An _Administration Application_ aimed at drastically simplifying the *deployment, administration and operation* of
your Big Data Cluster
* A _Data Science Laboratory_ and _Production environment_ where Data Analytics is both
** developed and
** operated in production

Eskimo is as well:

* a collection of ready to use docker containers packaging fine-tuned and highly customized plug and play services with
  all the _nuts and bolds_ required to make them work well together.
* a framework for building and deploying Big Data and NoSQL services based on docker and systemd

=== Key Features

Eskimo key features are as follows:

[cols=">.^20%,80%"]
|===
a|image::pngs/location.jpg[60, 60]| *Abstraction of Location*

Just define where you want to run which services and let eskimo take care of everything.

Move services between nodes or install new services in just a few clicks.

Don’t bother remembering where you installed Web consoles and UI applications, Eskimo wraps them all in a single and
consistent UI.

a|image::pngs/console.jpg[60, 60]| *Eskimo Web Console*

Eskimo’s tip of the iceberg is its flagship web console.

The Eskimo Console is the single and only entry point to all your cluster operations, from services installation to
accessing Kibana, Zeppelin and other UI applications.

The Eskimo Console also provides SSH consoles, File browser access and monitoring to your cluster.

a|image::pngs/framework.jpg[60, 60]| *Services Framework*

Eskimo is a Big Data Components service development and integration framework based on Docker and Systemd.

Eskimo provides out of the box ready-to use components such as Spark, Flink, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Mesos, Zeppelin, etc.

Eskimo also enables the user to develop his own services very easily.

=== The Service Developer Guide

This documentation is related to the last of the key features presented above : The Services Development Framework. +
It presents everything a developer needs to understand and know to develop his own services and let eskimo distribute
and operate them, or extend current services.

== Introducing the Service Development Framework

The *Service Development framework* is actually composed by two distinct parts:

* The <<docker_images_development_framework>> which is used to *build* the docker images deployed on the eskimo cluster
nodes
* The <<services_installation_framework>> which is used to *install and setup* these images as services on the eskimo cluster nodes.



=== Principle schema

The whole services development framework can be represented as follows:

image::pngs/services-development-framework.png[800, 800, align="center"]

* The <<docker_images_development_framework>> is used to develop and build Container templates images that are later
used to build the actual docker containers images that are fine-tuned to Eskimo deployed on invidiual Eskimo cluster
nodes
* The <<services_installation_framework>> which create the actual container image from the template and adapts it to the
specific situation of the eskimo node it is running on.

The different scripts involved in the different stages are presented on the schema above alon with their
responsibilities and the environment in which they are executed (outside of the container - on the eskimo host machine
or the eskimo cluster node - or from within the docker container).


=== Core principles

The core principles on which both the _Docker Images Development Framework_ and the _Services Installation Framework_
are built are as follows:

* A service is eventually two things
** a docker image packaging the software component and its dependencies
** a set of shell scripts aimed at installing and setting up the service
** a systemd unit configuration file aimed at operate it
* Everything - from building the docker image to installing it on cluster nodes - is done using simple shell scripts.
With Eskimo a system administrator desiring to leverage on eskimo to implement his own services in order to integrate
additional software components on Eskimo doesn't need to learn any new and fancy technology, just plain old shell
scripting, docker, systemd and perhaps a little bit of marathon configuration; that's it.
* Eskimo leverages on unix standards. Software components are installed in `/usr/local`, log files are in sub-folders of
`/var/log`, persistent data is in sub-folders of `/var/lib`, etc.

=== A note on images template download.

At eskimo first start, the user (administrator) needs to choose whether he wants to build the services images (docker
container templates images) locally or download them from _eskimo.sh_.

* *Buidling the images locally* means creating each and every docker template image using the `build.sh` script. Only
the vanilly software packages are downloaded from internet (such as the elasticsearch distribution, spark, flink, etc.). +
This can take a significant time, several dozens of minutes.
* *Downloading the images from internet* means downloading _ready-to-use_ docker template images from _eskimo.sh_

The whole setup process when downloading the images from internet can be represented this way:
