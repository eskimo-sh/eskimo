== Eskimo Architecture and Design Elements

This section presents various architecture and design elements of Eskimo.

=== SSH Tunelling

One of the most important feature of the Eskimo Web Console is its ability to provide in a single and consistent
Graphical User Interface al the underlying components administration Consoles such as the _Mesos Console_ or the _Kafka
Manager_, just as the essential Data Science Applications such as _Kibana_ and _Zeppelin_.

The Eskimo Frontend wraps these other web applications in it's own _User Interface_ and the Eskimo backend proxies their
HTTP data flows to their respective backend through SSH, in a transparent and secured way. +
The actual location of these software components (the runtime cluster node on which they are actually executed) is only
known by the eskimo backend and is handled automatically. +
Whenever such a console or service is moved from a node to another node, either manually or automatically by Marathon,
that is completely transparent to the end user.

=== Security

This section presents different important aspects of the security principle within Eskimo.

=== Confidentiality and cluster protection

The key principle on which Eskimo leverages consists in *protecting the cluster nodes from external accesses.

Eskimo makes it so that each and every access to the eskimo cluster services are made by itself. Eskimo acts as a proxy
between the external world and the eskimo cluster nodes (See <<ssh-tunneling>> above).

When building eskimo cluster nodes, administrators should ensure to leverage on `iptables` or `firewalld` to ensure

* Only IP addresses within the Eskimo cluster nodes range or sub-network can have open and wide access to the Eskimo
nodes.
* All external IP addresses (external to the eskimo cluster) would have access only to
** Port 22 for eskimo to be able to reach them - if the eskimo application itself is installed outside of the eskimo
cluster
** Port 80 of the node running eskimo - if the eskimo application itself is installed on one of the eskimo cluster node
(or the port on which Eskimo is answering

This principle is illustrated by the schema at <<sample_system_archi>>.

When setting up Eskimo, administrators have to provide the SSH private key certificate that Eskimo will use to access
all services running on internal eskimo cluster nodes.
It is of utmost importance to treat this key with great confidentiality and ensure it is only usable by the Eskimo
system user.

==== Data Encryption

Eskimo recommends to encrypt filesystem partitions use for data storage, either at hardware level if that is supported
or at Operating System level.

Especially following folders or mount points have to be encrypted:

* `/var/lib/spark` used for spark data and temporary data storage
* `/var/lib/elasticsearch` used as Elasticsearch storage folder
* `/var/lib/gluster` used for gluster bricks storage

It's also possible within Eskimo to customize the ElasticSearch instances setup script to leverage on ElasticSearch's
native data at rest encryption abilities.


==== User rights segregation and user imprersonation

Note on user impersonation and user rights segregation: Eskimo Community Edition doesn't support user rights segregation.
All users within Eskimo Community Edition are considered administrators and have full access to all Eskimo user and
administration features.

If user rights segregation, authorizations enforcement and user impersonation are key concerns for one's enterprise
environment, one should consider upgrading to *Eskimo Enterprise Edition which provides state of the art implementations
of each and every Enterprise Grade requirement*.


=== High availability

Eskimo Community Edition provides only partial HA - High Availability - support.

Basically:

* Flink and Spark applications leveraging on mesos are natively Highly Available and resilient to slave nodes vanishing.
* ElasticSearch as well is natively highly-available as long as the applications reaching it support using multiple
bootstrap nodes.
* All web consoles and administration applications leveraging on marathon (such as Kibana, Zeppelin, Cerebro,
the kafka-manager, etc. are natively available as well.

However in Eskimo Community Edition, some services are not highly-available and form single point of failure forcing
administrators to take manual actions when problems occur (service crash or node vanishing). +
These Single Point of Failure services - not highly available - are: Zookeeper, Mesos-Master, Flink App Master and
Marathon itself.

If full high-availability is an important requirement for one's applications, then one should consider upgrading to
*Eskimo Enterprise Edition which implements 100% high availability for every components*.
