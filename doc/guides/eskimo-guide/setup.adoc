== Setting up the eskimo cluster

Right after the initial setup presented in the previous chapter. The administrator can start setting up and installing
the Eskimo Big Data Analytics cluster.

The process is the following:

1. *Service settings configuration*. Fine tune the settings for the services one is about to install on the Eskimo cluster
2. *Nodes and native services layout configuration* : Declare the IP addresses of the nodes to me installed and operated
by eskimo and select the native services that should run on these nodes
3. *Marathon services selection* : Declare which of the marathon services you want to deploy on the cluster

=== Services settings configuration

The most essential settings for all eskimo pre-packaged services are set automatically in such a way that the nominal
use cases of an eskimo cluster work out of the box.

But for many specific use cases, the default values for these settings as handled by Eskimo are not sufficient. +
For this reason, Eskimo CE embeds a settings editor enabling administrators to find tune runtime settings for eskimo
embedded services.

The settings editor is available from the menu under "Configured Services":

For every service, administrators have access to supported configuration files and supported settings. +
The default values enforced by eskimo right after installation are indicated.


=== Nodes and native services layout configuration

The fourth menu entry under "*Platform Administration*" is the most important part of the Eskimo Administration console:
it provides the system administrators / Eskimo Users with the way to deploy the eskimo managed services on the cluster
of nodes to be managed by eskimo.

Eskimo services are docker containers managed (started / stopped / monitored / etc.) by systemd.

Setting up a cluster with eskimo usually boils down to these 2 phases :

* Adding nodes to the eskimo cluster - using the _Add Node_ button or ranges of nodes using the _Add Range_ button.
* Selecting the services that should be deployed and operated and the configured nodes

Below is an example of a tiny cluster with two nodes setup:

image::pngs/eskimo-nodes-config.png[800, 800, align="center"]

On the above example, we can see:

* One master node being configured as a standalone node configuration (which is always the case for nodes running
master or unique services) declaring master services as well as slave services.
* Two slave nodes being configured as a range of nodes with a single configuration declaring slave services.

==== Adding nodes to the eskimo cluster

Whenever one wants to operate a cluster of a hundred of nodes with Eskimo, one doesn't want to have to define the
hundred nodes one after the other. Not to mention that wouldn't make any sense since most nodes of that cluster would
actually have the very same configuration (in terms of services topology).

This is the rationality behind the notion of "_Range of nodes_"- The idea here is to be able to add a single and
consistent configuration to all the nodes sharing the same configuration.

Single node configurations and range of nodes can be combined at will. Eskimo will however refuse to apply configuration
if the resolution of the various ranges and single nodes leads to an IP address being defined several times.

Also, all nodes in a range are expected to be up and running and Eskimo will consider them so and report errors if one
node in a range is not answering. +
*Should you have holes in your range of IP addresses, you are expected to define multiple ranges, getting rid of the
holes in your range of IPs.* This is fairly important if you want Eskimo to be able to
successfully manage your cluster.

WARNING: In its current version (0.2 at the time of writing this document), eskimo *requires at all cost* nodes to be
defined using IP addresses and in no way are hostnames or DNS names supported. In this version of eskimo, only IP
addresses are supported, period. +
Unfortunately with big data technologies and especially spark and mesos, supporting DNS or hostnames is significantly
more complicated than direct IP addresses resolutions. +
We are working on this and the next version of eskimo will support working with hostnames instead of IP addresses. But
for the time being, administrators need to configure eskimo using IP addresses and only IP addresses.

==== Deploying services

With all nodes from the cluster to be managed by eskimo properly identified either as single node or as part of a range
of nodes, services can be configured and deployed.

==== Master services

Some service are considered *master services* and are identified on the _services selection_ window as unique services
(understand services that can be deployed only once, e.g. Kibana, Zeppelin, Mesos-Master, etc.) and configured using
a radio button

These "_Master services_" - considered unique - can only be configured in single node configuration and only once for
the whole cluster:

==== Slave services

Some other services are considered *slave services* and can be deployed at will, on one single or all nodes of the
cluster (understand services that can be deployed multiple times, e.g. elasticsearch, kafka, mesos-agent, etc.) and
configured using a checkbox on the _services selection_ window.

These "_Slave Services_" - considered multiple - can be configured at will:

[[apply_configuration]]
==== Applying nodes configuration

Once al nodes are properly configured with their desired set of services, clicking on "_Apply Configuration_" will
initiate the *Nodes Configuration process*.

That setup process can be quite long on large clusters with plenty of nodes even though a lot of tasks are performed in
parallel.

*One should note that this configuration can be changed at will! Master services can be moved back and forth between
nodes, slave services can be removed from nodes or added at will after the initial configuration has been applied,
Eskimo takes care of everything !*

As a sidenote, _Eskimo Community Edition_ doesn't support high availability for master services, one needs to acquire
_Eskimo Enterprise Edition_ for high availability.

*Applying configuration* is also useful when a service is reporting an error for instance such as needed restart or
being reported as vanished. +
In such cases a first step to resolve the problem is getting to the _"Configure Eskimo Nodes"_ screen and re-applying
configuration.

Finally, whenever an installation or another operation fails, after fixing the problem (most of the time correcting the
service installation scripts in the service installation framework), the installation or other operation process can be
recovered from where it failed by simply re-applying the configuration from here.

Applying node configuration is re-entrant / idempotent.

==== Forcing re-installation of a service.

The button "Force reinstall" enables the user to select services that will be reinstalled on every node from the
latest service docker image available. +
Dependent services will be properly restarted.


=== Marathon Services Selection

The last step in the Eskimo cluster installation consists in deploying marathon services.

This is performed by the fifth menu entry under "*Platform Administration*" called "*Config. Marathon Services*".

The process is actually very simple and one just needs to select the services to be installed and operated automatically
by marathon.

Just as for native node host services, Eskimo provides a possibility to force the reinstallation of marathon services. +
Just click on the "Force Reinstall" button and choose which services should be re-installed on marathon.
