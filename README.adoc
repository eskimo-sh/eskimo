== Eskimo Introduction

A state of the art _Big Data Infrastructure_ and _Management Web Console_ to _build_, _manage_ and _operate_
*Big Data 2.0 Analytics clusters*


image::doc/guides/eskimo-guide/pngs/eskimo-status.png[800, 800, align="center"]

Eskimo is in a certain way the Operating System of your Big Data Cluster:

* A _plug and play_, working _out of the Box_, *Big Data Analytics platform* fulfilling _enterprise environment
requirements_.
* A *state of the art Big Data 2.0 platform*
** based on _Docker_, _Marathon_, _Mesos_ and _Systemd_
** packaging _Gluster_, _Spark_, _Kafka_, _Flink_, _Nifi_ and _ElasticSearch_
** with all the administration and management consoles such as _Cerebro_, _Kibana_, _Zeppelin_, _Kafka-Manager_,
_Grafana_ and _Prometheus_.
* An _Administration Application_ aimed at drastically simplifying the *deployment, administration and operation* of
your Big Data Cluster
* A _Data Science Laboratory_ and _Production environment_ where Data Analytics is both
** developed and
** operated in production

Eskimo is as well:

* a collection of ready to use docker containers packaging fine-tuned and highly customized plug and play services with
  all the _nuts and bolds_ required to make them work well together.
* a framework for developing, building and deploying Big Data and NoSQL services based on _Docker_, _SystemD_ and
_Marathon_.

Eskimo Packages all the components above and takes care of all the nuts and bolts required to make them work together
smoothly and without the user or administrator needing to take care of anything.

== Information

Reach http://www.eskimo.sh for more information on Eskimo or look at the documentation in the folder `doc`.

== Building eskimo

=== Requirements

Eskimo uses plain old _Apache Maven_ for building (https://maven.apache.org/) as well as JDK 11+
(https://openjdk.java.net/) for both building and execution.

Minimum requirements are as follows:

* JDK 11 or greater
* Apache maven 3.5 or greater.

Every other dependency will be downloaded during the maven build process.

Theoretically, Eskimo can be built on any Operating System providing a command line and supporting Java 11+ (Note :
previous versions of JDK down to 8 may be supported without any guarantee) and Maven 3+. +
*However, the eskimo source tree makes an extensive use of symbolic links wich - unfortunately - are not supported on
Microsoft Windows*. +
For this reason, building eskimo on windows is absolutely possible but it is highly discouraged to develop eskimo on
Windows.


=== Building using maven

In order to build eskimo, simply run the following command in this very folder (the one containing this `readme.adoc`
file):

.Build Eskimo
----
mvn clean install
----

As a result of the build process, Eskimo is available as an extractable archive in `eskimo-_version_-bin.zip` or
`eskimo-_version_-bin.tar.gz` in the folder `target`.

=== Specific hints and troubleshooting information regarding eskimo building

You might want to read carefully the following additional information related to building eskimo.

==== Put maven and Java in PATH

Of course, for the above command to work, you need to have `java` and `mvn` in your path.

Use for instance the following commands on Linux:

.Put maven and java in PATH on Linux
----
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/lib/jdk-11
export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/lib/apache-maven-3.5.3
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
----

(You might want to put above commands in your `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`)

And for instance the following commands on Windows

.Put maven and java in PATH on Windows
----
set JAVA_HOME=C:\programs\jdk-11
set MAVEN_HOME=C:\programs\apache-maven-3.6.1
set PATH=%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
----


==== Install maven dependency trilead-ssh2


Eskimo used the library `trilead-ssh2` version `build-217-jenkins-27` which is not available in standard maven
repositories. +
This library is bundled with the eskimo sources in the folder `lib`. +
One can install it in his own local maven repository using the following command:

.Install _trilead-ssh2_ library
----
cd libs
bash install_libs.sh
----


=== Eskimo Build result

The build results at the end of the maven build process is located in the folder `target. +
The results are two archive files:

* A zip archive : `eskimo-_version_-bin.zip`
* A tarball archive : `eskimo-_version_-bin.tar.gz`

You can find pre-built packages of Eskimo on https://www.eskimo.sh.

The archive contains the full software packages with all dependencies and command line executables required to
start it as well as the full documentation, etc.

== Running Eskimo

This section gives instructions about running eskimo.

Eskimo itself can run on any Operating System supporting a JVM (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX) but cluster nodes are only
supported running Linux.

=== Prerequisites

==== System requirements

In order to run eskimo, one needs to have

* At least 15Gb of disk storage space on the machine running Eskimo
* At least one linux machine available on the network (can be the same machine than the one running Eskimo) with either
  a debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.), red-hat-based (CentOS, Fedora, etc.) or OpenSUSE Operating System.

(See https://github.com/eskimo-sh/eskimo/blob/master/doc/guides/eskimo-guide/eskimo-guide.adoc[The Eskimo User Guide]
for more information on Eskimo cluster requirements.)

Eskimo is reached using a web browser (see startup logs). Supported web browsers are:

* Microsoft Edge 12 or greater
* Mozilla FireFox 36 or greater
* Google Chrome 41 or greater

Note: there may be other browsers / versions supported (Safari, Opera but they are not certified to work with Eskimo)

==== Available JVM with Java in PATH

In order to run eskimo, one needs to have `java` in the path.

Use for instance the following commands on Linux:

.Put java in PATH on Linux
----
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/lib/jdk-11
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
----

(You might want to put above commands in your `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`)

And for instance the following commands on Windows

.Put java in PATH on Windows
----
set JAVA_HOME=C:\programs\jdk-11
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
----

=== Extract archive.

After building eskimo using maven, the zip and tarball archives are located in the folder `target`.

One of these archives needs to be extracted on the local filesystem.

Then in the folder `bin` under the newly extracted eskimo binary distribution folder, one can find two scripts:

* a script `eskimo.bat` to execute eskimo on Windows
* a script `eskimo.sh` to execute eskimo on Linux.

=== Access eskimo

With eskimo properly started using the above scripts, one can reach eskimo using http://machine_ip:9191. +
The default port number is 9191. This can be changed in configuration file `eskimo.properties`.

*The default login / password credentials are _admin_ / _password_.*

=== Typical startup issues

Several issues can happen upon first eskimo startup. +
This section describes common issues and ways to resolved them.

==== eskimo-users.json cannot be written

If you meet an error as the following on startup:

.Impossible to write eskimo-users.json
----
Caused by: ch.niceideas.common.utils.FileException: ./eskimo-users.json (Unauthorized access)
        at ch.niceideas.common.utils.FileUtils.writeFile(FileUtils.java:154)
        at ch.niceideas.eskimo.security.JSONBackedUserDetailsManager.<init>(JSONBackedUserDetailsManager.java:81)
        at ch.niceideas.eskimo.configurations.WebSecurityConfiguration.userDetailsService(WebSecurityConfiguration.java:127)
        ... 50 more
Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ./eskimo-users.json (Unauthorized access)
        at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.open0(Native Method)
        at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.open(FileOutputStream.java:276)
        at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:220)
        at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:170)
        at java.base/java.io.FileWriter.<init>(FileWriter.java:90)
        at ch.niceideas.common.utils.FileUtils.writeFile(FileUtils.java:149)
        ... 52 more
----

Eskimo uses a local file to define users and access credentials. Upon first startup, if that file doesn't exist already,
it is created by eskimo (with the default credentials above) at the path pointed to by the property
`security.userJsonFile` in `eskimo.properties`.

If you experience the error above or something alike, change that propery to point to a location where the first
version of the file can successfully be created.

== Eskimo source distribution layout

The directory structure of the eskimo source distribution is as follows:

* `doc` contains the source documentation in asciidoc format
* `libs` contains dependencies not available in standard maven repositories
* `packages_dev` contains the docker images development framework and packages
* `packages_distrib` is the destination folder in which downloaded or built images are placed
* `services_setup` contains the services installation framework and packages
* `src` contains the source files to build eskimo
* `test_lab` contains various tools to build VMs aimed at testing eskimo

== Test Laboratory

The folder `test_lab` folder in the Eskimo CE project root folder contains a *Vagrant* framework used to create virtual
machines to test Eskimo.

The supported virtual machines are declared in the file `VagrantFile` in the variable `nodes`:

.Vagrant Virtual Machines declaration
----
# Define cluster nodes
nodes = [
  { :hostname => 'deb-node1',  :box => 'debian/buster64',
                               :ip => '192.168.10.11', :ram => 8000 },
  { :hostname => 'deb-node2',  :box => 'ubuntu/xenial64',
                               :ip => '192.168.10.12', :ram => 6000 },
  { :hostname => 'cent-node1', :box => 'centos/7',
                               :ip => '192.168.10.13', :ram => 6000},
  { :hostname => 'cent-node2', :box => 'fedora/29-cloud-base',
                               :ip => '192.168.10.14', :ram => 6000 }
]
----

The defined VMs use different Operating Systems to test Eskimo's installation on different OSes. +
One can edit this variable to declare one's own VM's as required.

An individual VM is then started with `vargrant` using _VirtualBox_  as follows:

.Start deb-node1 with VirtualBox
----
$ cd ./test_lab/vagrant/
$ vagrant up deb-node1
----

Vagrant can also start VM's using libvirt / QEMU / kvm if the required libraries and provider are properly installed:

.Start deb-node1 with libvirt
----
$ cd ./test_lab/vagrant/
$ vagrant up deb-node1 --provider=libvirt
----
