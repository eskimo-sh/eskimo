# This script acts as a Watch Dog for docker containers when docker containers star background processes.
# When this happens, the docker container won't die unless the main process invoked by the run command - the one that
# keeps it waiting . stops.
# As a consequence, the background process have no chance to be restarted since the container won't ire if they crash
# unless the main process dies as well.
#
# Here comes the Watch Dog, it monitors a background process carefully and kills the main container process in case
# the background process dies.
# The Watch Dog takes both process IDs in argument
# - the first PID is the background process to be monitored
# - the second PID if the process to be killed in case the monitored background process vanishes
# A third argument is passed to log actions in the given log file
#
# A Watch Dog command should be invoked in background as well AFTER all the container process have been launched in
# background and BEFORE waiting on the main process.
# when using Watdh Dogs, even the main container process is started in background and "waited" (wait PID) in the end
# wait PID should be the last command in the startup script.
