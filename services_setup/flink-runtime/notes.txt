- test flink with
  docker run -it --user flink --network host \
      --mount type=bind,source=/home/flink/.kube/config,target=/home/flink/.kube/config \
      --mount type=bind,source=/usr/local/bin/kubectl,target=/usr/local/bin/kubectl \
      -v /var/log/flink:/var/log/flink \
      -v /var/lib/flink:/var/lib/flink \
      --mount type=bind,source=/etc/eskimo_topology.sh,target=/etc/eskimo_topology.sh \
      -v /etc/k8s:/etc/k8s:ro \
      kubernetes.registry:5000/flink bash
  + then
  /usr/local/lib/flink/bin/kubernetes-session.sh
->    and then see what it's doing and reproduce the yaml file for deployment
-> then get deployment with
   kubectl get deployment test-flink -o yaml
!!! CAUTION : I need to keep the container as close as possible to what is expected by flink to make it sure workers will
    be working as well as

- then test with :
cd /usr/local/lib/flink/
./bin/flink run ./examples/streaming/TopSpeedWindowing.jar
