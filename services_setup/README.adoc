== Eskimo Introduction

Eskimo is a Big Data Management Web Console to _build_, _manage_ and _operate_
*Big Data 2.0* clusters leveraging on  *Kubernetes*.

Reach http://www.eskimo.sh for more information on Eskimo or look at the documentation in the folder `doc`.

=== Eskimo Service Development Framework

The *Service Development framework* is actually composed by two distinct parts:

1. The *Docker Images Development Framework* which is used to build the docker images deployed on the eskimo cluster
   nodes
2. The *Services Installation Framework* which is used to install these images as services on kubernetes or natively on
   the eskimo cluster nodes.

This document presents "2. The *Services Installation Framework*"

=== Principle schema

The whole services development framework can be represented as follows:

ifdef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::pngs/services-development-framework.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
ifndef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
image::../doc/guides/service-dev-guide/pngs/services-development-framework.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]


* The *docker_images_development_framework* is used to develop and build Container templates images that are later
used to build the actual docker containers images that are fine-tuned to Eskimo deployed on Kubernetes or natively on
individual Eskimo cluster nodes.
* The <<services_installation_framework>> which creates the actual container image from the template image and adapts
it to the specific situation of the eskimo node or kube cluster on which it is being deployed.

The different scripts involved in the different stages are presented on the schema above along with their
responsibilities and the environment in which they are executed (outside of the container - on the eskimo host machine
or the eskimo cluster node - or from within the docker container).

[[services_installation_framework]]
== Services Installation Framework

The Services Installation Framework provides tools and standards to install the packaged docker images containing the
target software component on Kubernetes or natively on the eskimo cluster nodes.

Eskimo is leveraging on _Kubernetes_ to run and operate most of the services and the couple _docker_ and _SystemD_
for the few of them - such as gluster, ntp, etc - that need to run natively on Eskimo cluster nodes.

* An eskimo package has to be a docker image
* An eskimo package has to provide
** either a *systemd unit configuration file* to enable eskimo to operate the component natively on the cluster nodes.
** or a *Kubernetes YAML configuration file* to delegate the deployment and operation to Kubernetes.

The Eskimo Web User Interface takes care of installing the services defined in the `services.json`
configuration file and copies them over to the nodes where they are intended to run (native node or Kubernetes).
After the proper installation, eskimo relies either on plain old `systemctl` or `kubectl` commands to operate
(deploy / start / stop / restart / query / etc.) the services.

=== Principle

The principle is pretty straightforward:

* Whenever a service `serviceX` is to be deployed, eskimo makes an archive of the folder
`services_setup/serviceX`, copies that archive over to the target node and extracts it in a subfolder of `/tmp`.
* Then eskimo calls the script `setup.sh` from within that folder. The script `setup.sh` can do whatever it wants but has
to respect an important constraint.
* After that `setup.sh` script is properly executed, the service should be
** either installed natively on the node along with a systemd system unit file with name `serviceX.service` which is
used to control the _serviceX_ service lifecycle through
commands such as `systemctl start serviceX`,
** or properly deployed in Kubernetes and executing a POD name prefixed by the service name and a kube service matching
it. All of them being declared in a file `serviceX.k8s.yml.sh` which is actualyl a script generating the service file
after proper injection of Eskimo Topology and configuration.

The principle can be illustrated as follows:

ifdef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::pngs/services-installation-framework.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
ifndef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
image::../doc/guides/service-dev-guide/pngs/services-installation-framework.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]


Aside from the above, nothing is enforced and service developers can implement services the way they want.

==== Gluster share mounts

Many Eskimo services can leverage on gluster to share data across cluster nodes. +
SystemD services rely on the host to mount gluster shares and then mount the share to the gluster container from the
host mount. +
The way to do this is as follows:

* The service `setup.sh` script calls the script `/usr/local/sbin/gluster-mount.sh [SHARE_NAME] [SHARE_PATH] [OWNER_USER]` +
  This script will take care of registering the gluster mount with SystemD, fstab, etc.
* The service SystemD unit file should define a dependency on the SystemD mount by using the following statements +
  `After=gluster.service` +
  `After=[SHARE_PATH_HYPHEN-SEPARATED].mount`

Using the host to mount gluster shares is interesting since it enables Eskimo users to see the content of the gluster
share using the Eskimo File Manager.

The approach is very similar for Kubernetes services, except they can't be relying on SystemD (which is not available
to Kube containers) +
So Kubernetes services actually mount the gluster share directly from inside the docker container. +
The way to do this is as follows:

* The container startup script calls the script `inContainerMountGluster.sh [SHARE_NAME] [SHARE_PATH] [OWNER_USER]`

==== OS System Users creation

OS system users required to execute Kubernetes and native services are required to be created on every node of the
Eskimo cluster nodes with consistent user IDs across the cluster . For this reason,
the linux system users to be created on every node are not created in the individual services `setup.sh` scripts. They
are created by a specific script `/usr/local/sbin/eskimo-system-checks.sh` generated at installation time by  the eskimo
base system installation script `install-eskimo-base-system.sh`.

=== Standards and conventions over requirements

There are no requirements when setting up a service on a node aside from the constraints mentioned above.
Services developers can set up services on nodes the way then want and no specific requirement is enforced by eskimo.

However, adhering to some conventions eases a lot the implementation and maintenance of these services. +
These standard conventions are as follows (illustrated for a service called `serviceX`).

* Data persistency
** Cluster node native Services should put their persistent data (to be persisted between two docker container restart)
   in `/var/lib/serviceX` which shozld be mounted from the host by the called to docker in the SystemD unit file
** Kubernetes services should either rely on Kubernetes provided persistent storage or use a gluster share.
* Services should put their log files in `/var/log/serviceX` which is mounted from the runtime host.
* If the service requires a file to track its PID, that file should be stored under `/var/run/serviceX` to be mounted
  from the runtime host as well.
* Whenever a service `serviceX` requires a subfolder of `/var/log/serviceX` to be shared among cluster nodes, a script
`setupServiceXGlusterSares.sh` should be defined that calls the common helper script (define at eskimo base system
installation on every node) `/usr/local/sbin/gluster-mount.sh` in the following way, for instance to define
 the _flink data_ share : `/usr/local/sbin/gluster-mount.sh flink_data /var/lib/flink/data flink`
* The approach is the same from within a container, but the name if the script to call is different:
`/usr/local/sbin/inContainerMountGlusterShare.sh`.

At the end of the day, it's really plain old Unix standards. The only challenge comes from the use of docker and/or
Kubernetes which requires to play with docker mounts a little. +
Just look at eskimo pre-packaged services to see examples.

=== Typical setup.sh process

==== Operations performed

The setup process implemented as a standard in the `setup.sh` script has three different stages:

. The container instantiation from the pre-packaged image performed from outside the container
. The software component setup performed from inside the container
- The registration of the service to _SystemD_ or _Kubernetes_
. The software component configuration applied at runtime, i.e. at the time the container starts, re-applied everytime.

The fourth phase is most of the time required to apply configurations depending on environment dynamically at startup
time and not statically at setup time. +
The goal is to address situations where, for instance, master services are moved to another node (native deployment) or
moved around by Kubernetes. In this case,
applying the master setup configuration at service startup time instead of statically enables to simply restart a slave
service whenever the master node is moved to another node instead of requiring to entirely re-configure them.

The install and setup process thus typically looks this way:

1. From outside the container:
* Perform required configurations on host OS (create `/var/lib` subfolder, required system user, etc.)
* Run docker container that will be used to create the set up image
* Call in container setup script

2. From inside the container:
* Create the in container required folders and system user, etc.
* Adapt configuration files to eskimo context (static configuration only !)

3. At service startup time:
* Adapt configuration to topology (See <<topology>> below)
* Start service

And that's it.

Again, the most essential configuration, the adaptation to the cluster _topology_ is not done statically at container
setup time but dynamically at service startup time.

==== Standard and conventions

While nothing is really enforced as a requirement by eskimo (aside of SystemD / Kubernetes and the name of the
`setup.sh` script, there are some standards that should be followed (illustrated for a service named `serviceX`:

* The "in container" setup script is usually called `inContainerSetupServiceX.sh`
* The script taking care of the dynamic configuration and the starting of the service - the one actually called by
systemd upon service startup - is usually called `inContainerStartServiceX.sh`
* The systemd system configuration file is usually limited to stopping and starting the docker container
* The Kubernetes deployment file usually create a deployment (for replicaset) or a statefulset along with all services
  required to reach the software component.


==== Look for examples and get inspired

Look at examples and the way the packages provided with eskimo are set up and get inspired for implementing your own
packages.


=== Eskimo services configuration

Creating the service setup folder and writing the `setup.sh` script is unfortunately not sufficient for eskimo to be
able to operate the service. +
A few additional steps are required, most importantly, defining the new service in the configuration file
`services.json`.

[[services_json]]
==== Configuration file `services.json`

In order for a service to be understood and operable by eskimo, it needs to be declared in the *services configuration
file*  `services.json`.

A service declaration in `services.json` for instance for `serviceX` would be defined as follows:

.ServiceX declaration in `services.json`

    "CONTEXT_PATH"

  }
}

(Bear in mind that since json actually doesn't support such thing as comments, the example above is actually not a valid
JSON snippet - comments starting with '##' would need to be removed.)

Everything is pretty straightforward and one should really look at the services pre-packaged within eskimo to get
inspiration when designing a new service to be operated by eskimo.


[[topology]]
==== Eskimo Topology and dependency management

As stated above, the most essential configuration property in a _service definition_ is the `masterElectionStrategy`
of a dependency. +
The whole master / slave topology management logic as well as the whole dependencies framework of eskimo relies on it.

This is especially important for non-kubernetes services since most of the time the notion of "master" (in the eskimo
sense) is replaced by the usage of a kubernetes service to reach the software component deployed on Kubernetes.

==== Master Election strategy

Let's start by introducing what are the supported values for this `masterElectionStrategy` property:

* `NONE` : This is the simplest case. This enables a service to define as requiring another service without
bothering where it should be installed. It just has to be present somewhere on the cluster and the first service
doesn't care where. +
It however enforces the presence of that dependency service somewhere and refuses to validate the installation if the
dependency is not available somewhere on the eskimo nodes cluster.
* `FIRST_NODE` : This is used to define a simple dependency on another service. In addition, `FIRST_NODE` indicates that
the service where it is declared wants to know about at least one node where the dependency service is available. +
That other node should be the _first node_ found where that dependency service is available. +
_First_ node means that the nodes are processed by their order of declaration. The first node than runs the dependency
service will be given as dependency to the declaring service.
* `SAME_NODE_OR_RANDOM` : This is used to define a simple dependency on another service. In details,
`SAME_NODE_OR_RANDOM` indicates that the first service wants to know about at least one node where the dependency
service is available. +
In the case of `SAME_NODE_OR_RANDOM`, eskimo tries to find the dependency service on the very same node than
the one running the declaring service if that dependent service is available on that very same node. +
If no instance of the dependency service is not running on the very same node, then any other random node running the
dependency service is used as dependency. (This is only possible for native nodes SystemD services)
* `RANDOM` : This is used to define a simple dependency on another service. In details, `RANDOM` indicates that the
first service wants to know about at least one node where the dependency service is available. That other node can be
any other node of the cluster where the dependency service is installed.
* `RANDOM_NODE_AFTER` : This is used to define a simple dependency on another service. In details, `RANDOM_NODE_AFTER`
indicates that the first service wants to know about at least one node where that dependency service is available. +
That other node should be any node of the cluster where the second service is installed yet with a *node number*
(internal eskimo node declaration order) greater than the current node where the first service is installed. +
This is useful to define a chain of dependencies where every node instance depends on another node instance in a
circular way - pretty nifty for instance for elasticsearch discovery configuration. (This is only possible for native
nodes SystemD services)
* `SAME_NODE` : This means that the dependency service is expected to be available on the same node than the first
service, otherwise eskimo will report an error during service installation. (This is only possible for native nodes
SystemD services)
* `ALL_NODES` : this meands that every service defining this dependency will receive the full list of nodes running
the master service in an topology variable.

*The best way to understand this is to look at the examples in eskimo pre-packaged services declared in the bundled
`services.json`.*

For instance:

* Etcd wants to use the co-located instance of gluster. Since gluster is expected to be available from all nodes of the
eskimo cluster, this dependency is simply expressed as:

.etcd dependency on gluster
----
    "dependencies": [
      {
        "masterElectionStrategy": "SAME_NODE",
        "masterService": "gluster",
        "numberOfMasters": 1,
        "mandatory": false,
        "restart": true
      }
    ]
----

* kube-slave services needs to reach the first node where kube-master is available (only one in Eskimo Community
edition in anyway), so the dependency is defined as follows:

.kube-slave dependency on first kube-master
----
    "dependencies": [
      {
        "masterElectionStrategy": "FIRST_NODE",
        "masterService": "kube-master",
        "numberOfMasters": 1,
        "mandatory": true,
        "restart": true

* kafka-manager needs to reach any random instance of kafka running on the cluster, so the dependency is expressed as
simply as:

.kafka-manager dependency on kafka:

==== Memory allocation

Another pretty important property in a service configuration in `services.json` is the memory consumption property:
`memory`.

===== Services memory configuration

The possible values for that property are as follows :

* `negligible` : the service is not accounted in memory allocation
* `small` : the service gets a single share of memory
* `medium` : the service gets two shares of memory
* `large` : the service gets three shares of memory

The system then works by computing the sum of shares for all nodes and then allocating the available memory on the node
to every service by dividing it amongst shares and allocating the corresponding portion of memory to every service. +
Of course, the system first removes from the available memory a significant portion to ensure some room for kernel and
filesystem cache.

Also, Kubernetes services deployed as statefulSet on every node are accounted on every node; while unique kubernetes
services are accounted only partially, with a ratio corresponding to the amount of memory it would take divided by the
number of nodes. +
Since unique Kubernetes services are spread among nodes, this works well in practice and is realistic.

===== Examples of memory allocation

Let's imagine the following services installed on a cluster node, along with their memory setting:

Native services :

* *ntp* - negligible
* *prometheus* - negligible
* *gluster* - negligible
* *zookeeper* - small

Kubernetes services :

* *elasticsearch* - large
* *logstash* - small
* *kafka* - large
* *kibana* - medium
* *zeppelin* - very large

The following table gives various examples in terms of memory allocation for three different total RAM size values on the
cluster node running these services. +
The different columns gives how much memory is allocated to the different services in the different rows for various
size of total RAM.

|===================

(*For 3 nodes)

The services Kibana and Zeppelin are unique services running on Kubernetes, this example above accounts that there would
be 3 nodes in the clzster, hence their memory share is split by 3 on each node.

===== Kubernetes services memory configuration

The memory configures above is injected directly in the services themselves, without any consideration for the memory
requested by the corresponding Kubernetes POD. One should take that into account and declare a comparable amount of
memory when declaring the requested POD memory for Kubernetes Services.
In fact, one should declare a little more memory as Kubernetes requested memory for POD accounting for overhead.

===== Custom memory allocation

Every Eskimo service provides a mean to administrator to specify the memory the service process should be using in the
*Eskimo Service Settings* Configuration page.


==== Topology file on cluster nodes

Every time the cluster nodes / services configuration is changed. Eskimo will verify the global services topology and
generate for every node of the cluster a "*topology definition file*".

That topology definition file defines all the dependencies and where to find them (using the notion of MASTER) for every
service running on every node.
It also gives indications about the last known services installation status along with kubernetes memory and cpu
requests, etc.

The "topology definition file" can be fond on nodes in `/etc/eskimo_topology.sh`.

[[proxying]]
=== Proxying services web consoles

Many services managed by eskimo have web consoles used to administer them, such as the kubernetes dashboard, cerebro,
kafka-manager, etc.
Some are even only web consoles used to administer other services or perform Data Science tasks, such as Kibana,
Zeppelin or EGMI, etc.

With Eskimo, these consoles, either running natively or managed by kubernetes, are reach from within Eskimo and can be
completely isolated from the client network. +
Eskimo provides these Graphical User Interfaces in its own UI and proxies the backend call through SSH tunnels to the
actual service.

Proxying is however a little more complicated to set up since eskimo needs to perform a lot of rewriting on the text
resources (javascript, html and json) served by the proxied web console to rewrite served URLs to make them pass
through the proxy.

Eskimo provides a powerful rewrite engine that one can use to implement the rewrite rules defined in the configuration
as presented above.

*The minimum configuration that needs to be given to put in place a proxy for a service is to give a value to the
property `[serviceName].ui.proxyTargetPort` indicating the target port where to find the service (either on the cluster
npdes where it runs or through the Kubernetes proxy.).*

The different possibilities to configure rewrite rules and replacements are presented above in the section
<<services_json>>.

==== Source text replacements

Proxying web consoles HTTP flow means that a lot of the text resources served by the individual target web consoles
need to be processed in such a way that absolute URLs are rewritten.
This is unfortunately tricky and many different situations can occur, from URL build dynamically in javascript to static
resources URLs in CSS files for instance.

An eskimo service developer needs to analyze the application, debug it and understand every pattern that needs to be
replaced and define a *proxy replacement* for each of them.

===== Standard replacements

A set of standard proxy replacements are implemented once and for all by the eskimo HTTP proxy for all services. By default
these standard rewrite rules are enabled for a service unless the service config declares
`"applyStandardProxyReplacements": false` in which case they are not applied to that specific service. +
This is useful when a standard rule is actually harming a specific web console behaviour.

The standard replacements are as follows:

.Standard replacements
----

{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "src=\"/",
  "target" : "src=\"/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "action=\"/",
  "target" : "action=\"/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "href=\"/",
  "target" : "href=\"/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "href='/",
  "target" : "href='/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "url(\"/",
  "target" : "url(\"/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "url('/",
  "target" : "url('/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "url(/",
  "target" : "url(/{PREFIX_PATH}/"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "/api/v1",
  "target" : "/{PREFIX_PATH}/api/v1"
},
{
  "type" : "PLAIN",
  "source" : "\"/static/",
  "target" : "\"/{PREFIX_PATH}/static/"
},
----

===== Custom replacements

In addition to the standard rewrite rules - that can be used or not by a service web console - an eskimo service
developer can define as many custom rewrite rules as he wants in the service configuration in `services.json` as
presented above.

Some patterns can be used in both the `source` and `target` strings that will be replaced by the framework before they
are searched, respectively injected, in the text stream:

* `CONTEXT_PATH` will be resolved by the context root at which the eskimo web application is deployed, such as for
instance `eskimo`
* `PREFIX_PATH` will be resolved by the specific context path of the service web console context, such as for instance
for kibana `\{CONTEXT_PATH\}/kibana`, e.g. `eskimo/kibana` or `kibana` if no context root is used.
* `APP_ROOT_URL` will be resolved to the full URL used to reach eskimo, e.g. `http://localhost:9191/eskimo`


==== URL rewriting

URL rewriting is another mechanism available to fine tune eskimo proxying. +
Sometimes, a service backend sends a redirect (HTTP code 302 or else) to an absolute URL. In such cases, the absolute
URL needs to be replaced by the corresponding sub-path in the eskimo context.

This is achieved using URL rewriting rules.

.URL rewriting rule example for spark-console
----

      "urlRewriting" : [
        {
          "startUrl" : "{APP_ROOT_URL}/history/",
          "replacement" : "{APP_ROOT_URL}/spark-console/history/"
        }
----

The spark history servre uses such redirect when it is loading a spark log file for as long as the spark log file is
being loaded.
The rule above takes care or replacing such URL used in the HTTP redirect.


==== Page scripters

Page scripters form a third mechanism aimed at customizing the behaviour of proxied application. They consists of
declaring a javascript snippet that is injected at the bottom of the `body` tag in the referenced HTML document.


[[docker_images_versioning]]
== Docker Images Versioning

The different scripts presented above and available with each and every service as part of the _Services Installation
Framwork_ can be customized at will as ad often as required. +
Whenever one of these scripts is updated or customized, one simply needs to _reinstall_ the service using

* either the "_Setup Eskimo Nodes_" platform administration menu entry (for node native services)
* or the "_Setup Kube Services_" platformadministration menu entry (for node kubernetes services)

This can be done as frequentely as required.

The system works by incrementing the image tag number at each and every installation and restarting the service (either
using SystemD for native services, or _kubectl_ for Kubernetes services.

The first time a service is installed, it will get the number "1" as tag, the seond time will make the tag number
updated to the number "2", and so on. +
The system automaticically purges and clobbers the previous tags and the docker filesysten layers (overlay) that might
not be required anymore.


[[services_customizatio_tool]]
== Services Customization Tool

Services can be customized by updating or customizing the different scripts presented in
<<services_installation_framework>> above and available with each and every service. As explained in
<<docker_images_versioning>>, this can be done at will and one just needs to reinstall the corresponding service to make
his changes deployed on the system.

But eskimo also provides a utility tool to perform such customization on the live systen, without requiring to get
back to the eskimo UI and reinstall a service from the UI. +
Whenever one is develpping a new service or feature, havigng to get back to Eskimo and the full reinstallation procedure
is cumbersome. This script is intended for this purpose, being able to quickly evolve services in an efficient and easy
fashion.

The principle is illustrated as follows:

ifdef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::pngs/services-customization-tool.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
ifndef::service-dev-guide-embedded[]
image::../doc/guides/service-dev-guide/pngs/services-customization-tool.png[800, 800, align="center"]
endif::service-dev-guide-embedded[]


This tool takes the form of a shell script and is named `eskimo-edit-image.sh`.

.`eskimo-edit-image.sh usage
----
[root@test-node1 vagrant]# eskimo-edit-image.sh -h
eskimo-edit-image [-h] SERVICE [SCRIPT]
where SERVICE is the eskimo service / container name whose image is to be edited
SCRIPT is an optional script path to perfom customization
[root@test-node1 vagrant]#

----

It takes as argument the name of the service to be modified (which corresponds to the docker image name once a service
is installed) as well as an optional _shell script path_ aimed at performing the customization. +
If the customization script is omitted, then an interactive shell prompt is presented to the user for him to be able to
perform the customization interactively.

As an example, this would be the way to make the `vim` command available in the `cerebro` container:

.Install `vim` in cerebro
----
[root@test-node1 vagrant]# eskimo-edit-image.sh cerebro
 - Image to be edited is kubernetes.registry:5000/cerebro
 - Parsing arguments
 - Creating Kubernetes service DNS entries
 - Temp container name is e6d78843-9469-4ed2-bb04-a381d0e588a5

 - Launching Container ...
 - Invoking shell in container. You can now type commands!

After this operation, 36.9 MB of additional disk space will be used.

root@test-node1:/# exit
exit
 - Customization command exited successfully, will now save change as new tag in kubernetes.registry:5000/cerebro:2
 - Committing the changes to the container
 - Stopping container
 - Pushing image in docker registry
 - Deleting previous tag
 - Deleting previous container image tag 1
 - Attempting to delete it with registry tag as well
 - Searching for previous image tag 1 in registry to delete it (if appliable)
   + Deleting previous container image tag 1 from registry
   + Garbage collecting layers
----

As a result of the above sequence, a new tag version "2" will be available in the system for the docker image use by
the service `cerebro`. +
The user is then left with restarting _cerebro_ manually on Kubernetes, which can be done with the help of the
`eskimo-kubectl` command:

.restarting cerebro on Kubernetes
----
[root@test-node1 vagrant]# eskimo-kubectl restart cerebro kubernetes
 - Restart Service cerebro
   + Deleting cerebro
service "cerebro" deleted
deployment.apps "cerebro" deleted
   + (Re-)applying cerebro
service/cerebro created
deployment.apps/cerebro created
[root@test-node1 vagrant]#
